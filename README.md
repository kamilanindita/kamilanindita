## 🤝 Let’s Talk Tech (or Anything Fun)
Got something to share? Into code, side projects, or fun ideas? Let’s connect!
Find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamilanindita" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or just drop an email — always up for a good tech chat.

You can also visit <a href="https://kamilanindita.com" target="_blank">my website</a>, which is more than just a portfolio — it’s my personal digital lab where I document experiments, side projects, technical learnings, and ideas I’ve explored.
I believe technology is not just about solving problems, but also about collaboration, learning, and continuous growth.
